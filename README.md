# Project Euler
My solutions to some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, written as I stumble along learning Rust. I
shall only add the solutions to the first hundred problems here with the intention being to showcase whatever useful
data structures I build along the way. This is permitted according to the Project Euler guidelines.

I am not following the standard Rust project directory structure, because each Rust source file is an independent
program. For the same reason, I am using GNU `make` instead of Cargo.
