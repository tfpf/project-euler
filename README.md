# Project Euler
My solutions to some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, written as I stumble along learning Rust. I
shall only add the solutions to the first hundred problems here with the intention being to showcase whatever useful
data structures I build along the way. This is permitted according to the Project Euler guidelines.

To solve, say, problem 1, enter the following command.

```sh
cargo r 1
```

You can specify 0 to sequentially solve all problems for which solutions are written.

```sh
cargo r 0
```
